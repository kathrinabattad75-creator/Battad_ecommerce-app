# Battad_ecommerce-app
Description

This project is a Flask-based E-Commerce REST API developed for Activity 4 in IS 312. It demonstrates how Flask can be used together with an SQLite database to build a simple backend system for managing products and processing customer orders.

The application allows users to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations such as adding new products, viewing available products, updating product details, and deleting products from the database. It also includes order processing functionality, where a product can be purchased, the available stock is automatically reduced, and the total cost is calculated based on the quantity ordered.

Framework Used

Flask – A lightweight Python web framework used to create web applications and RESTful APIs. In this project, Flask handles API routing, request processing, and communication with the SQLite database.
